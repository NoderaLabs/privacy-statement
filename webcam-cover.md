# Privacy Statement (Virtual Webcam Cover)

Effective date: March 9, 2026

Virtual Webcam Cover is designed to run locally on your Mac and give you camera privacy controls.  
This statement explains what data the app handles and how it is used.

## What We Collect

Virtual Webcam Cover does not require an account and does not collect personal account data.

The app may process the following data locally on your device:

- Camera control settings (for example: block state, prompt mode, schedule rules, hotkey, launch-at-login preference).
- Recent camera activity entries shown in the app (for example: app display name, timestamp, decision type).
- Extension and setup status details needed to show readiness and troubleshooting information.

## Diagnostics Export

If you choose `Export Diagnostics`, the app creates a local JSON file that can be shared with support by you.

The exported diagnostics are sanitized and include runtime/configuration context such as:

- App/build and extension status information.
- Current lock/control state.
- Recent camera activity snapshot.
- Shared runtime state used for troubleshooting.

The diagnostics export excludes raw sensitive identifiers where possible:

- Raw bundle identifiers are hashed.
- Consumer details are redacted/hashed where applicable.
- Raw usernames, process IDs, and local file paths are not included.

Diagnostics are not uploaded automatically.

## Camera and System Permissions

Virtual Webcam Cover requests camera-related permissions required for virtual camera behavior and setup checks.  
System extension approval and camera privacy permissions are managed through macOS System Settings.

## Data Sharing

Virtual Webcam Cover does not automatically send your data to third-party servers.  
Data is shared only when you explicitly choose to share exported diagnostics or contact support.

## Data Retention and Control

- Most operational data is stored locally to provide app functionality.
- You can clear camera activity history in Settings (`Privacy` section).
- You can reset remembered prompt decisions in Settings (`Diagnostics` section).
- You can disable launch-at-login at any time.

## Children’s Privacy

Virtual Webcam Cover is not directed to children and does not knowingly collect personal information from children.

## Changes to This Statement

We may update this Privacy Statement when product behavior changes.  
The effective date above will be updated when changes are made.
